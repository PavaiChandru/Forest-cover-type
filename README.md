# Forest-cover-type
It aims in predicting the 7 different cover type on our test set. Performed benchmark model with different algorithms, finally hyper tuned adaboost classifier, k-nearest algorithm, extra tree classifier, Random forest, Gradient boosting classifier. Finally, I implemented ensemble method and soft voting classifier to perform the prediction analysis.
